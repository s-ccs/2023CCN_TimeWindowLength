Simulations/ Code for CCN 2023 TimeWindow project

All code is written in Julia using Pluto.jl notebooks. For a "cleaned" version of the code please refer to /PlutoNB/nb_CCN2023_unfoldEstimationWindow.jl;

Note: The application notebook is copied from our main interactive notebook repo. We copied it here for simplicity. If you want to check out the one used for the application please visit: https://github.com/s-ccs/interactive-pluto-notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/
